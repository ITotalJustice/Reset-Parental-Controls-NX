## What does it do

Pressing (A) will launch the applet for changing the pin for parental controls.

This can be used as a way to remove parental controls for those that have forgotten their pin.

If you *don't* have parental controls enabled, then pressing (A) will enable them once you enter a pin.

## How to remove parental controls

1. Go to system settings.

2. Parental Controls.

3. Change Settings (it will ask for the pin that you set using my app).

4. Once the pin is entered, press (X) to remove parental controls!
